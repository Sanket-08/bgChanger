# Background Color Changer React App

This GitHub repository contains a straightforward React application designed to change the background color of a web page. Users can select from a limited set of predefined colors to alter the background instantly.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for changing the background color.
- Several predefined color options for customization.
- Quick and smooth transition between background colors.
- Developed using React for easy integration into other projects.

## Code Overview

The primary functionality of this application is implemented within the `App` component. It utilizes React's `useState` hook to manage the background color state. The color-changing buttons are constructed using HTML buttons and styled using CSS classes. When a button is clicked, it triggers the `setColor` function to update the background color with a smooth transition.
